> Dear, Stranger.

　this is `      ` speaking to you through this short message.

　Hey there! i see you got my message huh? My name is Imor and it was so nice to know that you read this message, to be honest i have a lot of nicknames.. geez okay mister with many nicknames

　Maybe this is a ridiculous and not so important to you, this is a warning and how or when you can *interact* with a person like me. I'm very much an *aggressive person* is what i believe from the damage i've done in my past, which i regret it now honestly.. not something to be proud of even if it's tough it wasn't a reason for me to harm some innocents just because i'm destructive in some way on how people view me, well we all have our own view and opinion right?
 
　Honestly i don't really like dramatic person if their excuse is very unreasonable or somethings not worth to cry or sad to begin with also, i don't care if you can crush me or not threat me as much as you wanted because i just have to prove my own point and do bad things to you back and i won't let you view me as pathetic as you. I don't fear you, i just don't like to deal with someone like you unless you hit the target. If one day i talked shit about you i won't say the name here because i'll broke my own deal or contract. This is not a threat alright? So chill out! I love people hangin' around w me and mostly i hold it back and the rest? you'll see soon when you know me even deeper.
 
　Let's go back on track shall we?
